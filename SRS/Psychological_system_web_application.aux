\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\gls  {Scalability} is ability of a system to either handle increases in load without impact on the performance of the system, or the ability to be readily enlarged. There are two methods for improving scalability: scaling vertically (scale up), and scaling horizontally (scale out). To scale vertically, you add more resources such as CPU, memory, and disk to a single system. To scale horizontally, you add more machines to a farm that runs the application and shares the load. The key issues for scalability are:}{37}{section*.57}}

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\gls  {Security} is the capability of a system to reduce the chance of malicious or accidental actions outside of the designed usage affecting the system, and prevent disclosure or loss of information. Improving security can also increase the reliability of the system by reducing the chances of an attack succeeding and impairing system operation. Securing a system should protect assets and prevent unauthorized access to or modification of information. The factors affecting system security are confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The features used to secure systems are authentication, encryption, auditing, and logging. The key issues for security are:}{38}{section*.58}}
